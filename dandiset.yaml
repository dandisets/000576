description: 'We present an electrophysiological dataset collected from the amygdalae
  of nine subjects attending a visual dynamic stimulation of emotional aversive content.
  The subjects were patients affected by epilepsy who underwent preoperative invasive
  monitoring in the mesial temporal lobe. Subjects were presented with dynamic visual
  sequences of fearful faces (aversive condition), interleaved with sequences of neutral
  landscapes (neutral condition).


  We provide simultaneous recordings of intracranial EEG (iEEG) and neuronal spike
  times and waveforms, and metadata related to the task, subjects, sessions and electrodes
  in the NIX standard. We technically validated this dataset and provide here the
  spike sorting quality metrics and the spectra of iEEG signals.

  This dataset allows the investigation of amygdalar response to dynamic aversive
  stimuli at multiple spatial scales, from the macroscopic EEG to the neuronal firing
  in the human brain.'
